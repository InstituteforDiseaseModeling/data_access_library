# Data Access and Analysis Library Demo

This library provides a set of samples for accessing and analyzing data, including Python and R. 
It demonstrates the interactive and reproducible code snippets that can be shared with IDM reserachers.
The usage of `devcontainer` to set up a consistent development environment in Github codespaces can help you to get started quickly.

## 1. Usage of Devcontainer

The `devcontainer` feature in VS Code allows you to define the development environment using a Docker-based configuration. 
This ensures that all contributors to a project have a consistent setup, eliminating the "works only on my machine" problem. 
By using `devcontainer.json`, you can specify the required dependencies for Python and R, configure the environment, 
and set up additional tools like Jupyter and Quarto for sharing your work.

## 2. Quarto Examples Using Jupyter Notebook

Quarto is an open-source tool for technical publishing that enables you to create interactive, data-driven documents. 
It is built on top of the R Markdown format and supports Jupyter notebooks as part of its ecosystem.
This section provides examples of using Quarto with Jupyter notebooks for Python-based data analysis. 
The integration allows you to create rich, interactive documents that blend code, analysis, and markdown.

## 3. Quarto Examples Using `.qmd` for R

In this section, we explore how to use Quarto's `.qmd` format to create reproducible reports in R. 
Quarto simplifies the process of creating technical documents that include R code, plots, and analysis. 
The `.qmd` files serve as an efficient way to write and maintain both the narrative and the underlying code used in your analysis.
It is very similar to R Markdown but offers additional features and flexibility for publishing.
