It turns source code, text, and visuals into polished, shareable outputs. It is designed for seamless collaboration and reproducibility, making it an ideal tool for knowledge sharing amongst IDM data scientists, researchers, and developers.\nRich Quarto documents and notebooks also offer powerful potential for fine-tuning LLMs by integrating structured metadata, natural language explanations, and executable code. Leveraging front matter (YAML metadata) and code sections, we can extract clear, labeled training data, where explanations act as prompts and code as completions, advancing literate programming to a new level in the LLM era.\nQuarto Slide Deck\nCodespace Slide Deck\nReadMe\nQuiz"
